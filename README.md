# REV3-HIB

## Introduction

Handlebar Interface Board (HIB). This board is capable of taking an analog input from the potentiometer based throttle and converting it to a digital signal with the use of an STM32 microcontroller. This board is used to read the analog throttle signal and transmit it as a CAN message. There are ADCs for throttle and brake functionality. The board also has CAN loopback hardware for self-testing.
