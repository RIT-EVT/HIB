# REV3-HIB

## Introduction

Handlebar Interface Board (HIB). This board is capable of taking an analog input from the potentiometer based throttle and converting it to a digital signal with the use of an SPC58 microcontroller. This board is used to turn the throttle signal into a signal interpretable by the motor controller. There are ADCs for Throttle functionality, Braking functionality, and a button to start the motorcycle. All of these are feed into a Can loopback for validation.
